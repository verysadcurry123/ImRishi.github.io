In the near future, I plan to complete my Bachelor's degree in Business Economics at York University. After that, I intend to pursue a Master's in Accounting while simultaneously working towards my CPA certification. With these credentials, I aim to build a career in auditing, where I can apply my analytical skills and passion for finance and accounting to ensure financial integrity and drive organizational improvement.
